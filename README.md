# kill() System-Call-Implementation
This documentation explains the implementation of the kill system call using the C programming language. It describes the required header files, syntax, return values, and the conditions under which the call succeeds or fails. The kill system call is used to send signals to processes, and this project focuses on invoking it from within a C program rather than through the command line.
